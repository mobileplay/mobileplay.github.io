2) Has AirPlay been turned off on your TV device? Go to Settings &gt; Apple AirPlay and HomeKit and make sure AirPlay is set to On on your TV.
<strong>5) Why does the app that wants to mirror appear "Recording is not supported by this App" warning?
</strong>This app doesn't allow screen mirroring from your device for some reason like copyright, Please use web version or from another app that allows screen mirroring.

<strong>6) How to mirror video to TV

- Select your device and press Connect -&gt;
- After the connection is complete -&gt;
- Press the (+) sign in the lower right corner of the screen and select cast video -&gt;

<strong>7) How can I mirror Full HD content with WEB CAST function?
</strong>The default TV Cast for AirPlay app will take the video playing on your iDevice to play on your TV. For example you want to mirror video content in full HD quality from youtube, you need to select 1080 quality mode.

<strong>8) Some apps won&rsquo;t Screen Mirror, how is that possible?
</strong>Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV have decided to block this.
There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen Mirroring:

Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.

</strong>Try these steps first After each step, see if you still need help.
