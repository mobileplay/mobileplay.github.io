                <h3><b>4) Why is my TV device not appearing in the AirPlay menu?</b></h3>
                If you do not see your TV device when trying to use AirPlay to view content on your TV, you should check the following:
                <li>1) Are your TV device and Apple device connected to the same wireless network?
                You can view the network configuration of your devices in the settings menu. On your Roku device, go to Settings > Network > About</li>
                <li>2) Has AirPlay been turned off on your TV device?
                Go to Settings > Apple AirPlay and HomeKit and make sure AirPlay is set to On on your TV.</li>


                <h3><b>5) Why does the app that wants to mirror appear "Recording is not supported by this App"
                        warning?</b></h3>
                <p>This app doesn't allow screen mirroring from your device for some reason like copyright, Please use
                    web version or from another app that allows screen mirroring.</p>


                <h3><b>6) How to mirror video to TV</b></h3>
                <p>There are 2 ways: Use the [Cast Video] feature or the [Screen Mirroring] feature.</p>
                <p>With Cast Video:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Click Cast Video from the Home screen of the application ->
                    <li>- Select your device and press Connect ->
                    <li>- After the connection is complete ->
                    <li>- Press the (+) sign in the lower right corner of the screen and select cast video ->
                    <li>- Select your video to cast ->
                    <li>- It may take a long time if your video is too long. ->
                    <li>- After the video is processed, it will automatically play on your TV.
                </ul>

                <p>With Screen Mirroring:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>- Select [Screen Mirroring] from the Home screen of the app ->
                </ul>

                <h3><b>7) How can I mirror Full HD content with WEB CAST function?</b></h3>

                <p>The default TV Cast for AirPlay app will take the video playing on your iDevice to play on your TV. For
                    example you want to mirror video content in full HD quality from youtube, you need to select 1080
                    quality mode.</p>

                <h3><b>8) Some apps won’t Screen Mirror, how is that possible?</b></h3>

                <p>Some apps block Screen Mirroring. This means that application developers can choose themselves if
                    they want to block Screen Mirroring. For instance, Netflix, Disney+ and Apple TV have decided to
                    block this.<br>
                    There is a simple test that you can do to see if the app that you want to mirror has blocked Screen
                    Mirroring:</p>

                <p>Open that particular app and slide up Control Center on your iPhone/iPad. Then, click on Screen
                    Recording and start recording the screen to your Camera Roll. Watch the app that you want to mirror
                    and at some point stop the screen recording. Then go to your Photos app and watch the video that was
                    recorded. If the recorded video shows the app you want to mirror, it works fine. If the video is
                    empty, then the app you want to mirror does not allow Screen Mirroring.</p>


                <h3><b>9) If screen mirroring or streaming isn't working on your AirPlay-compatible device</b></h3>
                <p>Try these steps first
                    After each step, see if you still need help. 
                    
                    <li>1) Make sure that your AirPlay-compatible devices are turned on and near each other.</li>
                    <li>2) Check that the devices are updated to the latest software and are on the same Wi-Fi network. </li>
                    <li>3) Restart the devices that you want to use with AirPlay or screen mirroring.</li>
                    If you're prompted to enter a password, you might have restrictions turned on, or you might need to adjust your AirPlay password settings.</p>

                <h3><b>10) If you're asked to enter an AirPlay password on Apple TV</b></h3>
                <p>The first time you use AirPlay with your Apple TV, you'll see an onscreen password. Enter the password into your device to stream content to Apple TV. Or if you're using Conference Room Display, a message will always appear on the display with AirPlay connection instructions and wireless network details.</p>

                <h3><b>11) Where is the AirPlay code on my TV?</b></h3>
                <p>On the TV remote: Home button > Home Dashboard > Airplay > Airplay & Homekit Settings > Require Code > Use Password Instead. If you’ve set up a previous password, it gives you the password (or a new one)</p>

                <h3><b>12) How do I fix AirPlay problems?</b></h3>
