  <h1>What is the Authenticator app?</h1>
  <p>
    The Authenticator app generates secure two-factor authentication (2FA) codes for your accounts. When you set up your account with 2FA, you will receive a secret key to enter into the Authenticator app, usually in the form of a QR code.

    This establishes a secure connection between the Authenticator app and your account. Once the connection is established, the app will generate a 6-8 digit code that is required to access your account. Even if someone knows your password, they still need the 2FA code to access your account.
  </p>

  <h1>What is Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)?</h1>
  <p>
    Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) is an extra layer of security for your account in which users provide two different authentication factors to verify themselves. This process is done to better protect both the user's credentials and the resources the user can access.

    2FA provides a higher level of security than single-factor authentication (SFA), where the user provides only one factor, typically a password or passcode. 2FA methods rely on the user providing a password, as well as a second factor, usually a security code or a biometric factor such as a fingerprint or facial scan.

  <h1>What are the advantages of our Authenticator app?</h1>
  <p>
    Our Authenticator app is designed with security and privacy in mind. It offers a convenient experience for everyone with no account required. All data are encrypted by default, even if stored in iCloud. The app provides synchronization, backup, and a user-friendly native experience on all Apple devices.
  </p>

  <h1>How to enable Two-Factor Authentication on websites?</h1>
  <p>
    The majority of sites (such as Gmail, Office 365, Dropbox, Facebook, etc.) support Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) and usually provide a step-by-step guide on how to enable this security option. Alternatively, you can visit our 2FA Guides page for more information.
  </p>

  <h1>How can I receive a code for my Facebook account?</h1>
  <p>
    Each website has its own guide on how to enable Two-Factor Authentication. For more detailed instructions on how to enable 2FA for your Facebook account, you can visit our "How to Enable 2FA for Facebook" page.

    NOTE: If you haven't set up Two-Factor Authentication for your Facebook account, please contact Facebook support directly.
